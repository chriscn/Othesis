# Othesis
A Boat mangement system, originally written for the [UYBC](https://www.universityofyorkboatclub.co.uk). 
## The Repo
Currently a massive WIP - or another failed project of mine. Taking some inspiration from [Adam-RMS](https://adam-rms.com).
## The Stack
The project is written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). A language I have fallen in love with.
### API
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) 
- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
### App
- [React - TBC]()
## Development
The project is in very early development, and hence you are welcome to make any changes.  
The `ROADMAP.md` file contains a rough roadmap of where I'd like to be.
