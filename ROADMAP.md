# Roadmap
Below are the stages written in order of how I'd like to complete them.
## API & Database
- Robust, unit tested API with access to a database to store the data. 
- Decide of the schema fully and implement
## Front End
- Simple Boostrap App on the front end that connects to the backend through the API. 
## Maintenance
- New role `boathands`
- Allow categories to maintenance and allow assigning to specific boat
- Can either warn people on taking the boat out or outright block them from taking the boat out. 
## Other assets
- CoxBoxes
- ?Oars could be way more complicated
